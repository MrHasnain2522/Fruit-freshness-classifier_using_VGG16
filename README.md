# Introduction:
This project uses deep learning to classify images of fruits into six categories:
Fresh Apple, Rotten Apple, Fresh Banana, Rotten Banana, Fresh Orange, Rotten Orange.
With the power of a fine-tuned VGG16 model, the system achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between fresh and rotten fruits, making it useful for quality control and smart inventory systems in agriculture or retail.

#  Features:
   Trained VGG16 model with transfer learning
   6-class fruit classification (Fresh/Rotten Ã— 3 types)
   Image preprocessing and augmentation
   Model accuracy >96%
   Gradio-powered web app for real-time predictions
   Ready-to-deploy .keras model

# Tools & Libraries Used:
    Python
    TensorFlow / Keras
    NumPy / Pandas
    Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
    Gradio (for UI)
    Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

#  Data Preprocessing:
   Resizing all images to 256x256
   Normalizing pixel values
   Splitting into train and validation sets
   Data augmentation (flip, zoom, rotate)
